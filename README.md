AdvancedThaumaturgy
===================

Addon for Thaumcraft 4

If you have ideas, submit an issue.  If there is a REPRODICIBLE bug, submit an issue with a FULL Forge log and steps to
reproduce the bug.  I am not going to play 20 questions or hide-and-go-seek to track down some arbitrary bug.  Provide
details the first time, or don't submit an issue. ;)

Personal note:

I am new to java programming.  If you see 'dumb code' PLEASE fork, fix, and submit a PR.  Make sure you comment WHY
the old code was bad/stupid/inefficient and WHY the new code is better.  I cannot learn if you do not explain the
purpose of code changes.  If you don't explain, you may as well just listen to some retard on Youtube 'teaching' people
to code by just vocalizing what he is typing.
